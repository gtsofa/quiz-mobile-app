# quiz-mobile-app
The first release of the app will be very limited in scope but will serve as the foundation for future releases. It's expected that the player will be able to:

- Insert words and have them counted as a hit as soon as the player types the last letter of each word.
- After a hit, the input box will be cleared and the focus will remain on the input box.
- There will be a 5 min timer to finish the game.
    - If the player completes the quiz in less than 5 min, an alert will tell praise him.
    - If the player doesn't complete within 5 min, an alert will tell him his score.
 
- There will be a button to start the timer.
